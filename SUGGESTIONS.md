# Performance and Improvement Suggestions

This document outlines suggestions for improving the performance and overall architecture of the KF Bank - Client Management API.

## 1. Domain Layer (Core Hexagon) Optimizations

* **Avoid Lazy Loading:** Ensure domain objects are fully hydrated when needed, as your domain layer is "pure Java" and shouldn't rely on framework-specific lazy loading. This prevents unexpected latency.
* **Performance-Oriented Design Patterns:**
    * **Immutable Objects:** Use immutable objects where possible to enhance concurrency and reduce the need for locks.
    * **Aggregate Strategies:** Design aggregates to minimize data loading. Large aggregates can negatively impact persistence performance.
* **Asynchronous Domain Events:** For domain events triggering non-critical operations, process them asynchronously using an event bus or lightweight messaging system.

## 2. Application Layer Optimizations

* **Efficient Port Usage:** Design ports to minimize unnecessary data transfer.
* **Asynchronous Processing for Long Operations:** Utilize Spring's `@Async` or a message queue system (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for long-running use cases.
* **Early Validation:** Perform data validation as early as possible in the application layer to avoid unnecessary processing.

## 3. Infrastructure Layer Optimizations

* **Hibernate Fine-Tuning:**
    * **Second-Level Cache Strategies:** Leverage Hibernate's second-level cache to reduce database load.
    * **Fetching Strategies:** Review fetching strategies to prevent N+1 query problems.
    * **Database Indexing:** Ensure database tables are properly indexed for frequent queries.
    * **Connection Pooling:** Adjust the connection pool size to match application load.
* **Redis Optimizations:**
    * **Serialization Strategies:** Use efficient serialization for cached data.
    * **TTL (Time-to-Live):** Configure appropriate TTLs to avoid stale cache data.
    * **Redis Cluster:** For high availability and scalability, consider implementing a Redis cluster.
* **Spring Boot Optimizations:**
    * **Application Profiling:** Use profiling tools like VisualVM or JProfiler to identify performance bottlenecks.
    * **JVM Tuning:** Adjust JVM parameters (e.g., heap size, garbage collector) to match application load.
    * **HTTP/2 Usage:** Consider enabling HTTP/2 for improved REST API performance.
* **Actuator for Monitoring:**
    * **Custom Metrics:** Create custom metrics to monitor specific performance aspects.
    * **Alerting:** Configure alerts based on Actuator metrics to proactively detect performance issues.
    * **Prometheus and Grafana:** Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for advanced metric visualization and analysis.

## 4. GraphQL Optimizations

* **Data Fetchers:** Ensure data fetchers are optimized and avoid unnecessary database queries.
* **Batching and Caching:** Implement batching and caching in data fetchers to reduce database load.
* **Persisted Queries:** Consider using persisted queries to avoid repeated query parsing.

## 5. General Considerations

* **Load Testing:** Conduct regular load tests to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure the application can handle expected load.
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement a continuous monitoring strategy to proactively detect and resolve performance issues.
* **Efficient Logging:** Ensure logs are concise and avoid unnecessary overhead.
